# React 3d Studio

React studio is a simple modeling application for creating simple, 3d models for
React VR.

UI for creating, scaling and positioning React VR primitive shapes and exports them
as React VR a react VR component.

It's also built in React VR.

## What does it do?

Currently only enables you to build and place boxes and then export as React components.

## What should it do?

I'm hoping this can be a 3d studio for React VR to speed up the time when building
components. So a React developer can use an intuitive UI to create 3d models
that can be easily added into their React VR apps.

## What's still to do?

Pretty much everything.

* Add all other React primitives
* Enable object selection
* Enable object deletion
* Clean up the output component code
* 3d manipulators in viewport
* Component naming
* keyboard input for exact sizing
* Component grouping
* Colours and materials
* Origin display
* Better performance
* Improve menu response time
* Improve communication between menu and React env
* Actually enable the zoom feature
* Add Camera panning
* ... loads more
